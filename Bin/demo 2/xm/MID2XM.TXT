MIDI to XM File Converter (MID2XM) v1.4 - (c)1996-97 Ian Luck
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

What's the point?
=================
MID2XM is a MS-Windows program that, as the title suggests, converts
MIDI files into XM digital music modules (FastTracker 2 modules).

The purpose of MID2XM is to make it easier to create quality music
for demos, games or whatever. By using a MIDI sequencer and instrument
to record and edit the music before converting it with MID2XM to a XM
module. Rather than starting from scratch using a tracker.



Main Features

* Volume, pan, expression, modulation, hold(sustain), all notes off,
  all sounds off, reset controllers, pitch wheel, pitch wheel range
  and tempo MIDI events are all handled
* Supports MIDI file formats 0 and 1 (99.9% of all MIDI files)
* Easy to use front-end, no messing about with text editors and
  config files
* Selectable quantization resolution and rounding of notes
* Notification of any lost notes during conversion
* Optimization of patterns (eliminate duplicate patterns)
