# HeartLib Game Boy Advance Development API
Comprehensive API for Nintendo GBA inspired by HAMLib.

# The library
This library is undergoing heavy development. It is currenty my most heavily worked on GBA Project.

The library is designed to make GBA development way easier.

HeartLib has a TON of nice little functions for the user to play with that can manipulate registers, sprites, DMA, bitmaps,
palettes, bios calls, SRAM, memory, Interrupts, and a bunch of many other things.

HeartLib comes packed with a bunch of tools that you can use for graphics and sound, and it also comes with a semi-automated build system.

At the moment, it its only compatible with C. It will not work with C++.
